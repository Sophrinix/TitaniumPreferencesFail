#Update on this bug

##so I have an answer ( for now). What needs to happen is you have to manually set  in alloy.js or tiapp.xml s all of the properties you want in preferences, then when/ if the user does open preferences.xml file, it will work as advertised. If your preferences.xml defaults are different than what you initially set, the settings you set manually will win. However, once you change them in preferences.xml those win.
